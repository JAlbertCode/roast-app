A decentralized application where Sir Croaksworth, the savage frog banker, roasts users' crypto transactions across multiple blockchains.

## Project Overview

Sir Croaksworth's Roast DApp is a humorous application that analyzes blockchain wallet transactions and generates savage, personalized roasts that users can share on social media. The app uses Lilypad's Anura API for AI-generated content.

- Implemented placeholder roast generation with random responses
- Added Twitter sharing functionality
- Extended Tailwind configuration with custom animations

### Commit 3: API Integration
- Implemented etherscanService for fetching and analyzing wallet transactions
- Added anuraService for AI-powered roast generation using Lilypad's Anura API
- Created serverless API route for secure API key handling
- Added transaction summary display after roast generation
- Added error handling and loading states

### Commit 4: Animations and Character Design
- Created SVG representation of Sir Croaksworth character
- Implemented Framer Motion animations throughout the UI
- Added animated transitions for components
- Enhanced user experience with interactive animations

### Commit 5: Multi-Chain Support
- Removed chain selector for better UX
- Implemented automatic scanning of all configured chains
- Created aggregated data model for comprehensive transaction summary
- Updated UI to indicate multi-chain support
- Enhanced roast generation with cross-chain data

### Commit 6: Dark Mode Support
- Added dark mode toggle component
- Implemented theme persistence using localStorage
- Enhanced UI for dark mode
- Updated metadata and app title

### Commit 7: Enhanced Sir Croaksworth Character
- Created a better frog banker SVG with more details
- Improved animations with smoother transitions
- Added enhanced icons for wallet status indicators
- Resized and repositioned Sir Croaksworth for better visibility
- Added accessibility labels for screen readers

### Commit 8: Feedback Implementation
- Fixed API integration with better error handling
- Made roasts more specific, aggressive and shareable 
- Added multiple roast options with user selection UI
- Updated sharing button from Twitter to X with new design
- Fixed dark mode functionality with client-side hydration
- Ensured wallet addresses never appear in roasts

### Commit 11: UI Simplification and Image Generation
- Removed dark mode toggle for simplified UI
- Removed Next.js debug button
- Added RoastImage component for generating shareable images
- Added toggle to show/hide generated images
- Implemented image generation API endpoint
- Created fallback images for when API is unavailable

### Commit 13: Single Token Focus Optimization
- Modified prompts to focus on only one token/ticker in each roast
- Added specific examples showing good/bad practices for token references
- Implemented token selection logic to highlight specific tokens
- Enhanced special notes to suggest focusing on a specific token
- Added critical instruction to avoid referencing multiple tokens

## Current Status & Known Issues

1. **API Integration**: The Anura API integration is in place with robust error handling, automatic retry with Fast Mode, and improved fallbacks for roast generation.

2. **Witty Roasts**: Sir Croaksworth now produces wittier, more creative roasts with amusing frog puns and financial mockery.

3. **Multi-Chain Support**: The app automatically scans multiple chains (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Avalanche, Fantom, BNB Chain, Cronos, and zkSync Era) for which API keys are configured.

4. **Complex Wallet Handling**: Automatic Fast Mode for complex wallets with many transactions.

5. **Enhanced Fallbacks**: 75 unique fallback roasts with randomization to ensure variety.

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
2. **Deployment**: Prepare for deployment to Vercel
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Improve the mobile experience with better responsive design
4. **Analytics**: Add usage tracking to monitor popular features
5. **Social Integration**: Expand social sharing options beyond Twitter
6. **Image Gallery**: Create a gallery of recent roasts and generated images

## Environment Requirements

To run this application, you'll need:

1. **Etherscan API Key**: Required for fetching Ethereum transaction data
2. **Anura API Key**: Required for AI-generated roasts
3. **Optional API Keys** for other blockchains:
   - Polygonscan API Key (Polygon)
   - Arbiscan API Key (Arbitrum)
   - Optimism API Key (Optimism)
   - Basescan API Key (Base)
   - FTMScan API Key (Fantom)
   - BSCScan API Key (BNB Chain)
   - CronoScan API Key (Cronos)

**Note**: Avalanche (Snowtrace) and zkSync Era don't require API keys for free tier access.

## Getting Started

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with your API keys:
   ```
   ANURA_API_KEY=your_key_here
   
   # Required blockchain API keys
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_key_here
   
   # Optional blockchain API keys
   NEXT_PUBLIC_POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY=optional
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ARBISCAN_API_KEY=optional
   NEXT_PUBLIC_OPTIMISM_API_KEY=optional
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASESCAN_API_KEY=optional
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FTMSCAN_API_KEY=optional
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BSCSCAN_API_KEY=optional
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CRONOSCAN_API_KEY=optional
   
   # Note: No API keys needed for Avalanche or zkSync Era
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
