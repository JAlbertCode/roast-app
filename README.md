# Sir Croaksworth's Roast DApp - Development Progress

A decentralized application where Sir Croaksworth, the savage frog banker, roasts users' crypto transactions across multiple blockchains.

## Project Overview

Sir Croaksworth's Roast DApp is a humorous application that analyzes blockchain wallet transactions and generates savage, personalized roasts that users can share on social media. The app uses Lilypad's Anura API for AI-generated content.

- Added basic layout with wallet input and roast button
- Implemented placeholder roast generation with random responses
- Added Twitter sharing functionality
- Extended Tailwind configuration with custom animations

### Commit 3: API Integration
- Implemented etherscanService for fetching and analyzing wallet transactions
- Added anuraService for AI-powered roast generation using Lilypad's Anura API
- Created serverless API route for secure API key handling
- Added transaction summary display after roast generation
- Added error handling and loading states

### Commit 4: Animations and Character Design

- Implemented Framer Motion animations throughout the UI
- Added animated transitions for components
- Enhanced user experience with interactive animations

### Commit 5: Multi-Chain Support
- Removed chain selector for better UX
- Implemented automatic scanning of all configured chains
- Created aggregated data model for comprehensive transaction summary
- Updated UI to indicate multi-chain support
- Enhanced roast generation with cross-chain data

### Commit 6: Dark Mode Support

- Enhanced UI for dark mode
- Updated metadata and app title

### Commit 7: Enhanced Sir Croaksworth Character
- Created a better frog banker SVG with more details
- Improved animations with smoother transitions
- Added enhanced icons for wallet status indicators
- Resized and repositioned Sir Croaksworth for better visibility
- Added accessibility labels for screen readers

### Commit 8: Feedback Implementation
- Fixed API integration with better error handling
- Made roasts more specific, aggressive and shareable 
- Added multiple roast options with user selection UI
- Updated sharing button from Twitter to X with new design
- Fixed dark mode functionality with client-side hydration
- Ensured wallet addresses never appear in roasts

### Commit 10: API Error Handling
- Fixed JSON parsing error in Anura API integration
- Added improved error detection for HTML responses
- Enhanced fallback roast system with generic options for new wallets
- Fixed Next.js config warning about invalid postcssOptions
- Added better error messaging in the UI
- Fixed syntax errors in anuraService.ts

## Current Status & Known Issues

1. **API Integration**: The Anura API integration is in place but may need adjustments depending on the actual API responses. We've implemented robust error handling and fallbacks.

2. **Dark Mode**: The dark mode toggle functionality should be working but needs more testing.

3. **Roast Generation**: The roast generation now produces 3 different options for users to choose from.

4. **Multi-Chain Support**: The app automatically scans all chains for which API keys are available.

5. **Client Components**: Added "use client" directives to all React components that use client-side hooks and libraries like Framer Motion.

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
2. **Deployment**: Prepare for deployment to Vercel
3. **Loading Animations**: Add loading states and animations for better UX
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Improve the mobile experience with better responsive design
5. **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling for network failures and API limits

## Environment Requirements

To run this application, you'll need:

1. **Etherscan API Key**: Required for fetching Ethereum transaction data
2. **Anura API Key**: Required for AI-generated roasts
3. **Optional API Keys** for other blockchains:
   - Polygonscan API Key (Polygon)
   - Arbiscan API Key (Arbitrum)
   - Optimism API Key
   - Basescan API Key (Base)

## Getting Started

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with your API keys:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_key_here
   ANURA_API_KEY=your_key_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_POLYGONSCAN_API_KEY=optional
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ARBISCAN_API_KEY=optional
   NEXT_PUBLIC_OPTIMISM_API_KEY=optional
   NEXT_PUBLIC_BASESCAN_API_KEY=optional
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend**: Next.js with React and TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions and animations
- **API Integration**: 
  - Blockchain explorers for transaction data
  - Anura API for AI-powered roast generation
- **State Management**: React useState/useEffect hooks
- **Dark Mode**: Client-side with localStorage persistence

## Future Improvements
